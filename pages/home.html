					<span class="mu-header-dot"></span>
					<p style="text-align:left;"> I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <b>University of Cambridge</b>, UK. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from <b>KTH Royal Institute of Technology</b>, Sweden, in 2023. During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting scholar at the <b>Georgia Institute of Technology</b>, US (Nov 2021 â€“ Apr 2022). I hold M.Sc. (2018) and B.Sc. (2015) degrees in Computer Engineering from <b>Middle East Technical University</b> (METU), Turkey.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">While pursuing my M.Sc. degree, I began conducting research at the <a href="https://kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/" style="color:#479799;">Kovan Robotics Lab</a> with Prof. Sinan Kalkan. During my doctoral education, I continued robotics research at the <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl" style="color:#479799;">Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning</a> under the supervision of Prof. Iolanda Leite. As part of my doctoral degree, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. Sonia Chernova's research group, the <a href="https://rail.gatech.edu/" style="color:#479799;">Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning Lab</a>. In my current postdoctoral research, I work with Prof. Hatice G&#252;ne&#351; in the <a href="https://cambridge-afar.github.io/" style="color:#479799;">Affective Intelligence and Robotics Lab</a>.</p>
